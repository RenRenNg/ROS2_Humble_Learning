source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash or source ~/.bashrc (if you have place the source command inside bashrc)  
cd /opt/ros/humble #This where all the packages are installed

What is Rviz:  
A 3D visualisation tool  
There are displays on the left; gird, RobotModel and TF  
Checking and unchecking TF will show/hide the axis  
RobotModel > Links > Show all links of the robot  
Back to the TF:  
**Are the links between the axes specifically with respect to which link**  
**And how they move relative to each other**  
### **Relationship between TFs. TF tree**  
While the Rviz is running  
ros2 topic list > /tf   
ros2 topic echo /tf #Show all the TFs
